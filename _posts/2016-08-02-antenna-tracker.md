Mobile Auto Antenna Tracker is designed to enlarge the flying range of the model plane or unmanned aircraft. It also brings about the convenience for the following service for the unmanned-aircraft by coupling antenna tracker with the moving car or mobile platform. The progress is made by obtaining the GPS information of both the plane and the ground tracker.

This project was awarded as an outstanding project in 19th Shanghai Undergraduate Innovation Program.
