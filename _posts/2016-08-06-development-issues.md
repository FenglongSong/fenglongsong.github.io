 The process of air film holes of aircraft engine turbine blade has a high rejection rate due to the error in the position and posture of workpiece. In this research, we acquire point cloud data using laser displacement sensor, then use matching algorithm to calculate the position and posture of the blade, and finally make adjustments accordingly during the processing. 

 When fixed by fixtures, there is always positioning and posturing error between the workpiece and fixtures, about several milimeters or degrees. Although tiny, this error can be fatal when machining air holes on aero-engine turbine blades, considering thousands of holes need to be made on an area of several square centimeters. Factory No.170 in Guiyang, Guizhou Province has undertaken over 70% of the production of military turbine blades in China. Previously, workers in this factory had to make adjustment by manual observation to make sure the blade is at the correct position and posture. In this way, precise adjustments are difficult to be made, which brings a high reject rate in hole-making process. Considering each blade worths thousands of dollars, this adds to the cost greatly.

I participated in this project under the instruction of Prof. Wansheng Zhao in State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration, Institute of Manufacturing Technology and Equipment Automation. My contribution was mainly on point cloud registration and calibration of laser displacement sensor.

## My contribution
I write code for Iteration Closet Point (ICP) algorithm to calculate the homogeneous transform matrix between two sets of point clouds, which are generated by scanning the turbine blades using laser displacement sensor and extracted from the CAD model of blades, respectly. First, I tested the algorithm using MATLAB, then I wrote the code in python.

I also used a data structure called KD-tree to optimize the searching process.

With time, moderation, and proper instruction, children with autism spectrum disorder are able to form friendships after realizing their own strengths and weaknesses. A study done by Frankel et al. showed that parental intervention and instruction plays an important role in such children developing friendships. Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.

Although lessons and training may help peers of children with autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of The New York Times, bullying is most likely to occur against autistic children who have the most potential to live independently, such as those with Asperger syndrome. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with full autism, but they are more likely to be mainstreamed in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children on the autism spectrum have more difficulty picking up on social cues of when they are maliciously being made fun of, so they do not always know when they are being bullied.
