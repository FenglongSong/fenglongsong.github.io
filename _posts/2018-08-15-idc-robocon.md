  IDC ROBOCON (International Design Contest) is one of the three major competitions of NHK Robocon in Japan. It was the communication between Tokyo University of Technology and MIT mechanical creative design course in the United States at the earliest in 1990, and later extended to several top engineering colleges in the world. IDC focuses on the communication between students from different countries and has a high requirement on the ability to design and manufacture in mechanical, circuit, software, etc.
      
  
  I participated in IDC ROBOCON 2018 during Aug. 5th to Aug. 19th in Tokyo Institute of Technology, along with Yuliang Zhong, Mian Wang, Jiayuan Hu and Jingyong Li from SJTU. I was in team red and my four teammates are from Singapore, India, Japan and Mexico. We had a pleasant and unforgettable cooperation and finally we won the NSK Award.
