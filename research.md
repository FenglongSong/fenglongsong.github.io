## Design and fabrication of a quadrupedal robot for complex terrain

As the mobile carrier of many functional robots, intelligent walking vehicle has important applications in the fields of military reconnaissance, disaster rescue, mineral exploration and planetary exploration. At present, relevant research focuses on how to extend the motion range of intelligent walking car from artificial structured scenes to wild and other unstructured scenes. In order to enable the mobile car to not only pass at high speed and efficiently on the flat road surface, but also climb on the steep hard rough surface in the field, this project combines the legged robot and the micro-spines climbing mechanism to design a mobile car that can adapt to the above two scenarios. The project includes the design of the legs and body of the mobile vehicle, the design of the foot climbing mechanical structures and the design of high-level controller based on Virtual Model Control. This paper focuses on the body and legs design, diagonal trot gait control method, prototype production and testing. A low-cost and light-weight quadruped vehicle was designed and fabricated, which has shown good performance in walking on flat surface with trot gait and climbing steep slopes.
